    <p class="description"> <strong>Schabowy</strong> is a Polish variety of pork breaded cutlet coated with
        breadcrumbs similar to
        Viennese schnitzel or Italian Cotoletta and South American Milanesa but made of loin (with the bone or without),
        or with pork chop. There's also the Polish variety of the chicken breast cutlet coated with breadcrumbs looking
        somewhat similar, or the turkey cutlet coated with breadcrumbs made the same way. </p>

    <p class="description"> The history of the Polish pork cutlet schabowy <em>dates back to the 19th century</em>. The
        collection of
        different recipes for cutlets such as schabowy is featured in an 1860 cookbook by Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa
        entitled 365 obiadów za pięć złotych (365 Dinners for Five Zloty), but missing from the 1786 cookbook by
        Wojciech Wielądek called Kucharz doskonały (The Perfect Chef), thus suggesting, that the dish wasn't known (or
        at least, wasn't popular) before the 19th century. Typical ingredients include: eggs, lard or oil, spices, pork
        loin with or without bone, breadcrumbs and flour. </p>

            vegetables (seared cabbage), with salads or with coleslaw.</li>
